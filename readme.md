# Room Surveillance

A DIY surveillance camera for my room.

## Why ?

Because I'm a paranoid person.

## How to run ?

Install dependancies:

```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the local webserver:

``` 
  python main.py -i IP -o PORT
```

## Can I use this ?

Yes but no! (You shouldn't tbh).

## Todo

- [ ] Take pictures when motion is detected
- [ ] Improve UI
- [ ] Deploy on homeserver
- [ ] Run on ROS ?
- [ ] Add a laser turret that blinds intruders.
